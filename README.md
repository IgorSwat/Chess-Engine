# Lazarus

Lazarus is a C++, bitboard-based chess engine with neural network and other cool stuff.

The origin of the name comes from the history of the project's creation and the multiple, deep refactorings it has experienced.

## In development
Unfortunately, this is not a final version of the project. 
Despite completing most of the key stages and bringing the project to a usable state, there are still some significant improvements and functionalities missing, without which the project cannot be considered ready.
For this reason, the engine is not yet ready for final testing and measurement of its playing strength.

Among the milestones already completed, the most important ones can be highlighted:
- Board and pieces representation&nbsp; <img src="md/check.png" alt="Check icon" width="20" height="20">
- Sliding piece attacks, magic bitboards&nbsp; <img src="md/check.png" alt="Check icon" width="20" height="20">
- Full game rules implementation - enpassant, pins, checks and promotions&nbsp; <img src="md/check.png" alt="Check icon" width="20" height="20">
- Move generation algorithms&nbsp; <img src="md/check.png" alt="Check icon" width="20" height="20">
- Transposition table&nbsp; <img src="md/check.png" alt="Check icon" width="20" height="20">
- Basic search&nbsp; <img src="md/check.png" alt="Check icon" width="20" height="20">
- Quiescence search&nbsp; <img src="md/check.png" alt="Check icon" width="20" height="20">
- Selectivity heuristics&nbsp; <img src="md/check.png" alt="Check icon" width="20" height="20">
- Neural network model (NNUE) implementation and training&nbsp; <img src="md/check.png" alt="Check icon" width="20" height="20">

The most important missing functionalities are:
- Multi-threaded search&nbsp; <img src="md/delete.png" alt="Delete icon" width="20" height="20">
- Opening book & endgame tablebase connection&nbsp; <img src="md/delete.png" alt="Delete icon" width="20" height="20">
- Time management&nbsp; <img src="md/delete.png" alt="Delete icon" width="20" height="20">
- UCI and connection with custom GUI&nbsp; <img src="md/delete.png" alt="Delete icon" width="20" height="20">
